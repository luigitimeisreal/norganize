Script that changes file extensions of the files inside its directory.
 If you want you can contribute in any of these:
- Improve the program, so it can act recursively on directories too. 
- Improve the variable names.
- Make code more readable.
- Make the program faster by using better alternatives (libraries or functions).

When contributing make sure to follow the same style as the rest of the project.
